TODO:
  1. Search for each CVE on github using smart search and limiting
languages/formats/etc.
  2. Apache SVN has a mirror on Github. Should we use it?
  3. What to do with git web interface? (ack-grep "commit" data/nist_feed/json*)
  4. Should we crawl urls given by NVD? E.g.:
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7490 does not have a
link to github, but has one to https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4142,
which leads to https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/uwsgi,
which leads to
https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/commit/0a480f435ea6feb63deb410ad2bf376ed3f05f8a
and
https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/commit/cb4636f7c0af2e97a4eef7a3cdcbd85a71247bfe.
Or is it enough to just crawl debian security tracker et al.?
?
  7. Append all newly found urls in a file for manual review. Separate the urls
into classes.
  8. Figure out how many cves are in proprietary software.
  9. Map cpe records, (also python, java, js, ruby packets) to github
repositories. Search for cves in the repositories. Motivation: many popular
projects have mirrors on github, most of the Pip packets are also hosted on
github, ...


Patterns to check:
  1.  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libvpx/+/fdb1b40e7bb147c07bda988c9501ad223795d12d
  2.  https://sourceforge.net/p/libpng/code/ci/d9006f683c641793252d92254a75ae9b815b42ed/
(SVN =( )
  3. How to check that a link leads to a git/svn repo?
  7. Everything that has the "commit" string inside (needs aditional validation)
  8. Everything that has the "gerrit" string inside (needs aditional validation)




Places to look:
  1. https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/
  2. https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database - grep it for github
commits (a commit is usually a patch)
  3. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/
  5. Bug Bounty Hubs
  6. https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-compress/security-reports.html
and similar apache projects (https://issues.apache.org/jira,
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/)
 10. https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-08-07/ + git log | grep "SECURITY"
