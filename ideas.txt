TODO:
  1. Search for each CVE on github using smart search and limiting
languages/formats/etc.
  2. Apache SVN has a mirror on Github. Should we use it?
  3. What to do with git web interface? (ack-grep "commit" data/nist_feed/json*)
  4. Should we crawl urls given by NVD? E.g.:
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7490 does not have a
link to github, but has one to https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4142,
which leads to https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/uwsgi,
which leads to
https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/commit/0a480f435ea6feb63deb410ad2bf376ed3f05f8a
and
https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/commit/cb4636f7c0af2e97a4eef7a3cdcbd85a71247bfe.
Or is it enough to just crawl debian security tracker et al.?
?
  7. Append all newly found urls in a file for manual review. Separate the urls
into classes.


Patterns to check:
  1.  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libvpx/+/fdb1b40e7bb147c07bda988c9501ad223795d12d
  2.  https://sourceforge.net/p/libpng/code/ci/d9006f683c641793252d92254a75ae9b815b42ed/
(SVN =( )
  3. How to check that a link leads to a git/svn repo?




Places to look:
  1. https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/
  2. https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database - grep it for github
commits (a commit is usually a patch)
  3. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/
  4. https://securitytxt.org/
  5. Bug Bounty Hubs
  6. https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-compress/security-reports.html
and similar apache projects (https://issues.apache.org/jira,
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/)
  7. Everything that has the "commit" string inside (needs aditional validation)
  8. Everything that has the "gerrit" string inside (needs aditional validation)
  9. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/fake-names
 10. https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-08-07/ + git log | grep "SECURITY"
